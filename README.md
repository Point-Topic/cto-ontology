# Common Telecommunications Ontology (CTO Ontology)
(In development)

A common and general ontology for telecommunications networks and the telecoms sector, developed by Point Topic Ltd (www.point-topic.com). 

Originally based on and extended from the TOCO ontology created by Qianru Zhou: https://github.com/QianruZhou333/toco_ontology.git

The purpose of this ontology is to capture and represent the multi-domain nature of telecommunication data:
- organisational
- geospatial
- technical
- socio-economic
- commercial

## Vocabulary
Vocabulary is divided into 
- class
- object property
- data property

The ontology makes use of terms from other vocabularies, including Dublin Core and DCAT.
