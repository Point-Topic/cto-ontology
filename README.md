# Common Telecommunications Ontology (CTO Ontology)
(In development)

A common and general ontology for telecommunications networks. 

Originally based on and extended from the TOCO ontology created by Qianru Zhou: https://github.com/QianruZhou333/toco_ontology.git

This development is part of an on-going project which is addressing the convergence of telecommunication networks across multiple technology domains. 

The DIL pattern is observed and summarised through the ontology developing progress. It could describe all kinds of networks. 

Build around the DIL pattern, the ToCo ontology describes the physical infrastructure, quality of channel, services and users in heterogeneous telecommunication networks which span multiple technology domains across the networks. Examples and use cases of ToCo in recent projects are discussed in publications.
